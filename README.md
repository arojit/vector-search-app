# vector-search-app
This project is a mini vector search engine built with FAISS, OpenAI Embeddings, and Flask. It demonstrates how to convert text into embeddings (vectors), index them using FAISS, and expose a REST API to search for semantically similar content - just like how search engines, chatbots, or recommendation systems work under the hood.
